# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

It has to be a React JS application.
It has to implement the API and not just hardcode data from the API.
It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly an image(UI is completely up to you) and another screen to show it’s summary.
The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details.
(Reload should not happen)
(Use local/session storage for storing user details)
A proper UI so that we know you have a good understanding of UI/UX. Doesn’t need to have mind blowing animations but just basic HTML and CSS styling that looks good (You may use bootstrap).
Please use proper Component file structure.
